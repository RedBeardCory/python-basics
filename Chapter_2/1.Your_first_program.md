# Your First Program

Gee that last section was long! Hopefully you have your hot beverage and are feeling ready to tackle what comes next. This is where the fun begins in my books!

For something easy to get started with we are going to make a program that will generate you a random number. Not very Glamourous but it will be a great starting point, trust me ðŸ˜‰.

## The Example Code

```python

import io

def main():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

## Running the Example

## Next Steps

In the next few sections I'll be breaking down the example into all the different parts that make up the program. We will then keep on building the example code together with the knowledge that we learn along the way!
