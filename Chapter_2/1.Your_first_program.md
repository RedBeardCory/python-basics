# Your First Program

Gee that last section was long! Hopefully you have your hot beverage and are feeling ready to tackle what comes next. This is where the fun begins in my books!

For something easy to get started with we are going to make a program that will generate you a random number. Not very Glamourous but it will be a great starting point, trust me ðŸ˜‰. But first let's start with something even simpler, a staple amongst programmers. The "Hello World!" program!

## The Code

`./hello_world.py`

```python
def main():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

> you can find this code in the same chapter if you don't want to write it out yourself.

## Running the Example

Running the example can be done by opening the `hello_world.py` file in vscode and simply clicking the run button. A terminal should appear down the bottom of the window and print out our majestic "Hello World!" text.

For a bit of fun, go ahead and change the `World` to your name and rerun the file. You should have been greeted by your own computer, nice work!

## Next Steps

In the next few sections I'll be breaking down some example code into all the different parts that make up the program. We will then keep on building the example code together with the knowledge that we learn along the way!
