# Python Basics

## What is in this guide?

This guide will contain some tailored lessons to learning the basics of programming with python. It's aimed at absolute beginners and will hopefully be a great starting point for someone who knows nothing of programming to becoming competent enough with python to use it in their own projects!

## Why Python?

Why did I choose python? Well I'm a software engineer and I use it professionally so it has become second nature to me. I also think it's an exellent starting point for someone who is completely fresh on the scene of computing and programming due to it's ease of use.

## Inspiration

Recently I have begun learning rust lang for embedded programming and was going through thier embedded guide which is absolutely amazing. It made me think, I want to write something like this for python so that people who are brand new to programming can have just as good as experience as I did there.
